Writers are [KBC components](/overview/) that take transformed and processed **output data from KBC**
and deliver it **into its final destination:** the systems and applications where the data gets used/**consumed**.

## Types of Writers
We integrate your data into most of the top market systems.
Choose the right consumption point for each project and use case. Like with Extractors,
there are **no limitations** to how and where you can send your data.

Writers can be grouped by their primary purpose:

- **Business Intelligence**: [Tableau](/writers/tableau/), [GoodData](/writers/gooddata/),
YellowFin, SAS Visual Analytics, Chartio, Periscope, Looker and more.
- **Marketing Solutions**: Facebook, Adwords Custom Audiences, Marketo, Mailchimp, Silverpop,
Trading desks and more.
- **DWH/DB/Storage**: Oracle, SAP, Teradata, AWS, Informix, Dropbox, Drive, FTP, Redshift, Elastic,
BigQuery, [Keboola Connection Storage](/writers/storage-api/), and more.

[comment]: # - [Keboola Connection Storage](/writers/storage-api): writes data to a Keboola Connection project in a different

## Working with Writers
Each writer can have multiple configurations.
Each configuration represents a combination of data and destination.

We provide tutorials on [writing into GoodData](/tutorial/write/gooddata/) and
